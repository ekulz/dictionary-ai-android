# Dictionary AI Android

Open AI powered dictionary app, built entirely by ChatGPT.

## Prompt

> I want you to act as a software developer. I will provide some specific information about some system requirements, and it will be your job to come up with an architecture and code for developing an Android application. My first request is ‘I want a system that allows users to enter some words or sentences, and translate that into another language that the user chooses. It should be powered by Open AI's API.’
